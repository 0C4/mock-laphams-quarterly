# MOCK LAPHAM'S QUARTERLY

These are mock versions of Lapham's Quarterly issues of topics that havn't been covered yet. They are fan art of sorts as I highly admire the quarterly's design and purpose. Currently, all the mock-copies are highly incomplete and inaccurate (clearly). At them moment, they are mostly scaffolding with much of the text to be included as time permits.

#### Remark on Original Content
I don't own any of the original image or text materials. I make no such claim and have not to anybody. I am not making money off building these documents. Full citations will eventually be included; its proven easier to add it in once a document is complete. I don't own the design of the mock issues - they are templated off the Laphams Quarterly issues I recieve from my subscription. They are built using a ruler and guessing the best matching colors.
