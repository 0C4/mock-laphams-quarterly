# (MOCK) LAPHAM'S QUARTERLY

These are mock versions of Lapham;s Quarterly issues of topics that havn't been covered yet. Basically they are fan art of sorts. I highly admire the quarterly's quality and decided to have a bit of fun. Obviously, all the mock-copies are highly, highly incomplete. At them moment, they are mostly scaffolding with much of the text to be included as time permits.

#### Remark on Original Content
I don't own any of the original image or text materials. I make no such claim and have not to anybody. I am not making money off building these documents. Full citations will eventually be included; its proven easier to add it in once a document is complete. I don't own the design of the mock issues - they are templated off the Laphams Quarterly issues I recieve from my subscription. They are built using a ruler and guessing the best matching colors.
